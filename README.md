## About

ABS Wear is a standalone version for Android Wear OS 4.0, currently there is no plan to develop a version for Watch OS (Apple). This project is made for fun as a weekend project. This project is not part of the audiobookshelf core as it is written in Flutter instead of Vue. ABS Wear is a 3rd party project and is not affiliated with the original project.

## Getting Started üöÄ

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*This template includes only the Android runner, as it is meant to run on Wear OS devices only._

---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

---

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "serverUrlLabel": "Server URL",
    "@serverUrlLabel": {
        "description": "Label for the server URL input field"
    },
    "usernameLabel": "Username",
    "@usernameLabel": {
        "description": "Username for the input field"
    },
    "passwordLabel": "Password",
    "@passwordLabel": {
        "description": "Password for the input field"
    },
    "hello": "Hello {username}",
    "@hello": {
        "description": "Hello text with parameter: username",
        "placeholders": {
            "username": {
                "type": "String",
                "example": "Bob"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "serverUrlLabel": "Server URL",
    "@serverUrlLabel": {
        "description": "Label for the server URL input field"
    },
    "usernameLabel": "Username",
    "@usernameLabel": {
        "description": "Username for the input field"
    },
    "passwordLabel": "Password",
    "@passwordLabel": {
        "description": "Password for the input field"
    },
    "hello": "Hello {username}",
    "@hello": {
        "description": "Hello text with parameter: username",
        "placeholders": {
            "username": {
                "type": "String",
                "example": "Bob"
            }
        }
    },
    "library": "Library",
    "@library": {
        "description": "Text for Library"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:audiobookshelfwear/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.library);
}
```
